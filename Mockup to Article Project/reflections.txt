Your response goes here!
  * What new skills have you learned?
  I had to carefully assess the mockup to identify the best structure that will produce exactly what is in the image. Structure is quite important - first lesson learned.

  * What has been easy?
  Using the appropriate elements were easy.

  * What has been difficult?
  Nothing so far.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  The project did not demand a lot of effort. However, the segmenting and structuring techiques were quite helpful in producing the required output.
